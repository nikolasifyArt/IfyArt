    <h1>I Am Self Taught:</h1>
    <p>Welcome I am NikolasIfy
      <br>
      <span class="text-highlight">
        I am a self-taught artist who has been creating digital art for over 10 years. My passion for art began at a age
        of 20, and I have spent countless hours honing my craft and developing my skills. I specialize in digital
        painting, illustration, and graphic design, and I am constantly exploring new techniques and styles to push the
        boundaries of my creativity. I am inspired by the world around me, and I strive to capture the beauty and
        complexity of life in my artwork. I believe that art has the power to inspire, uplift, and connect people, and I
        am dedicated to sharing my work with others to create a positive impact on the world. Thank you for visiting my
        website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my art!
